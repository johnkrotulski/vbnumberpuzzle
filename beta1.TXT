The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\My Documents\Programming\visual Basic\puzzle\Package\beta1.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\My Documents\Programming\visual Basic\puzzle\Package\Support\beta1.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
